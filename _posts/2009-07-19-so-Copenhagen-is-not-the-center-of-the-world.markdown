I was recently asked to start blogging in english instead of danish. This makes sense since I start making more online friends these days - I also hope to be able to contribute more back to the various communities I am a part of.

<i>"What is the meaning of your blog title"</i> you might think? To me being pedantic is not necessarily a bad thing. Try looking the word up in various dictionaries , and you'll see that the word "pedant" mostly has negative connotations. From wiktionary : <em>A person who is overly concerned with formal rules and trivial points of learning</em>.  That's me - and a good focus for my blog. "trivial points of learning" are easy to write in a blog entry - and formal rules are interresting to me as a programmer.
</p>

<p>
So I'll write a lot of small details and trivial things here;)
