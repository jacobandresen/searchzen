<strong>Update 2011-4-17 : I deleted the project on github </strong>.

<strong>Update 2010-10-16: I renamed the example project ExtBeer to "Beer".
</strong>
I have downloaded <a href="http://www.extjs.com/products/designer/?ref=family">the ExtJS Designer</a> and tried it out . It has some minor kinks , but it looks like it is in a usable state. I left some notes<a title="here" href="http://www.slideshare.net/jacobandresen/using-the-ext-js-designer"> here</a> , and an example project <a title="here" href="http://github.com/jacobandresen/Beer">here</a> .
