Now that an <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jag/entry/so_long_old_friend">era has passed</a> then I thought I'd write up a list things that you can do if you want to use open source variants of projects now maintained by Oracle.

MySQL is now also maintained as maria-db. Today I switched my home mysql server to maria-db using the instructions <a href="http://nerdvana.us.mirror.ourdelta.org/deb/dists/lenny/mariadb-ourdelta/">here</a> .

The  <strong>JDK</strong> is now opensource and can be retrieved by issuing  "sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk" on debian.

openoffice now has an accelerated development cycle at <a href="http://go-oo.org/">go-oo</a>

<a href="https://opensso.dev.java.net/">opensso</a> is now maintained by forgerock  in the <a href="https://wikis.forgerock.org/confluence/display/openam/Home">OpenAM</a> project.

Oh yes. For those of you that have been using <a href="http://netbeans.org/">netbeans</a> , I would recommend you take a look at <a href="http://eclipse.org/">eclipse</a> . (Oh .. <strong>eclipse?</strong><em> .. now I get it)
