Alas, Google wave is no more. I knew it well.

Or.. rather. I knew the api's well. All the cool technology behind it - I knew that.  The google wave team tackled some tough issues to get it up and running. Google wave included an implementaion of  <a title="Operational transforms" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation">Operational transforms</a> for largescale realtime collaboration. <a title="google wave API" href="http://code.google.com/intl/uk/apis/wave/">The google wave api</a> was also pretty nifty.

Now - when thinking about it , I remember email conversations about google wave - facebook conversations about google wave. Real life conversations about wave. Hackathons about wave. I never actually did anything useful in wave itself.  All the fun memories I have about google wave is basically learning about new technologies and meeting new people. There is nothing bad in hacking on interesting tech - during this process I learned about google app engine, cloud computing, python,  protocol design and some longhaired math - all these things are usefull to me in the long run.

It looks like that <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/update-on-google-wave.html">some of  the technologies of google wave will live on in other google products</a>.  One of the main features - realtime collaboration in documents is now available in google docs.
